= Division of maps: Isomorphisms

+ $(h compose d)(x) = h(2x) = 1/2 * 2x = x$. Similarly, $(d compose h)(x) = d(1/2 x) = 2 * 1/2 x = x$.

+ $f$ should map odd to negative and even to positive. This is because odd + odd = even, and negative $times$ negative = positive.

+ $a$ is not an ismorphism - take for example 0 and 1. $a (0 + 1) = 2 eq.not a 0 + a 1 = 1 + 2 = 3$. $b$ isn't because it's not invertible. For example, $(-1)^2 = 1$, but the inverse square root function would give 1. For the same reason, $c$ is not an isomorphism. $e$ does not respect the combining rule, and $f$ is not a map of sets. Of these, only $d$ is a genuine algebraic isomorphism.
