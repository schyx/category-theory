+ Each of the three elements of $A$ can be mapped to one of the two elements of $B$, so $2^3 = 8$.

+ $3^3 = 27$.

+ $3^2 = 9$.

+ $2^2 = 4$.

+ The maps that satisfy $f compose f = f$ must be surjective of which there are $3 * 2 * 1 = 6$. The 2 maps where none of the three elements are fixed do not satisfy $f compose f = f$, but the other 4 do.

+ Same as above, except both surjective maps satisfy $g compose g = g$.

+ No pair of maps satisfy $g compose f = 1_A$. This is because $|B| lt |A|$, so there cannot be a surjective $g : B arrow.r A$.

+ There are 6 maps injective maps from $h : B arrow.r A$. For each of these injective maps, there are 2 possible maps $k : A arrow.r B$ such that $k compose h = 1_B$ because the one element of $A$ not in the image of $h$ can be mapped to either of the two elements of $B$. Thus, $6 * 2 = 12$ pairs of maps satisfy this relationship.
