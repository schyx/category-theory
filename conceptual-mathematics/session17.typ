= Some uses of graphs

+ Graphs $a, b, c,$ and $e$ have terminal objects. For $a, b, e$, it's the rightmost element, and for $c$, it's the
  second-to-rightmost element.

+ For the forward direction, if the graphs commute, then the path of length 2 is equal to a path of length 0, so the two
  maps are inverses of each other.

  For the backward direction, if the two maps are inverses of each other, we consider all pairs of objects. If the pairs
  are two of the same object, then we must show that $(f g)^n = 1_A$ and $(g f)^n = 1_B$, which we have due to the maps
  being inverses of each other. Similar, if the two pairs are different, we must show $f(g f)^n = f$ and $g(f g)^n =
  g$, which we again have due to the inverse property.

+ Symbol push based on the equalities given.

+ + $g = h, f g = 1_B$.
  + $1_A = h g f, 1_B = f h g, 1_C = g f h$.
  + $i = 1_C, f = g, 1_A = j h f, 1_B = f j h, 1_C = h f j$.
