= Categories of diagrams

+ This is given by the following chain of equalities:
$ (f compose alpha^3)(x)
= (beta compose f compose alpha^2)(x)
= (beta^2 compose f compose alpha)(x)
= (beta^3 compose f)(x)
= beta^3(y) $

+ $y$ "settles into an organized periodic behavior" in 1 unit of time, and $z$ does in 3.

  The diagram for a lightbulb will be 9 nodes, the first 8 in a line and the final in a loop signalling that the bulb
  will stay off.

+ All of these can be reasoned about semantically. For the first, someone's mother's gender will be the same as
  operating on their gender with the map $G$. The same holds for someone's father.
