= Products in categories

+ The three cycle, with $0 -> 1$, $1 -> 2$, and $2 -> 0$. This would send $0 -> (0, 0), 1 -> (1, 1), 2 -> (2, 2), 3 ->
  (0, 3), 4 -> (1, 4), ..., 23 -> (2, 7)$.

+ The product $C_m times C_n$ is $text(gcd)(m, n)$ $text(lcm)(m, n)$-cycles.

+ It is the product map, since starting at any point and applying the endomap will get you to the exact same points as
  if you applied the endomaps to the individual maps.
